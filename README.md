**PLEASE NOTE:** Due to a change in the way sockets work in PHP 8.0, the websockets.php library used is no longer compatible. See (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.socket-accept.php#refsect1-function.socket-accept-changelog). It is recommended that you install the equivalent `php7.4-cli` package for your system.
